# DriftScape - A Quick Overview

**DriftScape** is an exploration game where you wander a grid-based world that grows as you move. Start at (0,0), type commands like `move north`, and watch new regions—like forests or plains—spring to life. Each region is a Kubernetes pod, spawned dynamically, with Go powering the fast, random generation. A Coordinator tracks your journey, and the world expands infinitely, blending tech and adventure in a minimalist package.
